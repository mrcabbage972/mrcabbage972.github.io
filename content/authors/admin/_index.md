#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
Hello Internet.

I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google Cloud. My work currently focuses on AI for software engineering. Previously I've been a ML Engineering Manager at Chegg, where I led a team fine-tuning VLM's for multimodal question answering. Before that,  I was working on recommender systems and multi-lingual NLP at Taboola.

Among my contributions to the open-source software communitiy, I worked with <a href="https://www.ontocord.ai/">Ontocord</a> to create the multilingual Large Language Model <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/mayank-mishra/aurora">Aurora-M</a>.
 Previously, I took a small part in the LAION <a href="https://open-assistant.io/team">OpenAssistant</a> project.
