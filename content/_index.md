        ## About Me
        ![Avatar](/authors/admin/avatar.jpg)

        Hello Internet.

        I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google Cloud. My work currently focuses on AI for software engineering. Previously I've been a ML Engineering Manager at Chegg, where I led a team fine-tuning VLM's for multimodal question answering. Before that,  I was working on recommender systems and multi-lingual NLP at Taboola.

        Among my contributions to the open-source software communitiy, I worked with <a href="https://www.ontocord.ai/">Ontocord</a> to create the multilingual Large Language Model <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/mayank-mishra/aurora">Aurora-M</a>.
        Previously, I took a small part in the LAION <a href="https://open-assistant.io/team">OpenAssistant</a> project.
