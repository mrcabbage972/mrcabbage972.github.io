Hello, Internet.

I’m a Staff Software Engineer at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), based in New York City, currently focused on AI for software engineering. Previously, I led a team at [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com) fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal question answering. Before that, I worked on recommender systems and multilingual NLP at [Taboola](https://www.taboola.com/).

I hold an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics from [Bar-Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en).

I contribute to open-source AI projects. Most recently, I collaborated with [Ontocord](https://www.ontocord.ai/) on [Aurora-M](https://huggingface.co/blog/mayank-mishra/aurora), a multilingual large language model. I also participated in the [OpenAssistant](https://open-assistant.io/team) initiative by [LAION](https://laion.ai/).
