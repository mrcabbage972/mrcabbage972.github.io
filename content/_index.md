Hello, Internet.

Iâ€™m a Staff Software Engineer at Google Cloud, based in New York City, currently focused on AI for software engineering. Previously, I led a team at Chegg fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal question answering. Before that, I worked on recommender systems and multilingual NLP at Taboola.

I hold an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from Tel Aviv University and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Bar-Ilan University.

I contribute to open-source AI projects. Most recently, I collaborated with [Ontocord](https://www.ontocord.ai/) on [Aurora-M](https://huggingface.co/blog/mayank-mishra/aurora), a multilingual large language model. I also participated in the [OpenAssistant](https://open-assistant.io/team) initiative by LAION.
